        description: 'There\'s been no official announcement regarding John Wick: Chapter 4\'s streaming release. However, given it\'s a Lionsgate film, John Wick: Chapter 4 will eventually be released on Starz.',
        text: 'John Wick: Chapter 4 is the first movie of 2023 to receive a review score of 10 from IGN. It\'s a must-see for action fans, as Keanu Reeves turns in his best Wick performance yet in a film that our John Wick: Chapter 4 review called "a modern action masterclass.\n\nIt\'s one of the best Keanu Reeves movies you\'ll ever see. Lionsgate has signed multiple streaming deals over the past couple of years that see the company\'s movies stream first on Starz, then the Roku Channel, then Peacock.\n\nGiven this multi-tiered approach, we can\'t provide a solid estimate on when you can expect John Wick: Chapter 4 to hit streaming services. We\'ll update this article with the latest information as it becomes available.'

        description: 'Max Verstappen believes his fellow two-time world champion Fernando Alonso "deserves a lot more" victories in Formula 1.',
        text: 'Verstappen and Alonso have shared the podium together in each of the opening three races of the season, with the Aston Martin driver having finished third in all three Grands Prix so far this year for the resurgent Silverstone outfit.\n\nAlonso’s start to the season has led many, including Verstappen – who famously raced with the number 33 on his car until the start of the 2022 season – to believe the Spaniard is not too far from securing that elusive 33rd win of his career.\n\n“I think Fernando should have won, already, a lot more races than he has done. I think he deserves a lot more,” said Verstappen, while sat next to Alonso at the Thursday drivers\' press conference in Melbourne.\n\n“So I would be quite happy to see him win number 33. But I also, in a way, would like to see him win more. So, we\'ll see in the coming races.”'

        description: 'Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both scored twice as Liverpool claimed a first win in five Premier League games inflicting successive home hammering.',
        text: 'The Reds had not won since putting seven unanswered goals past Manchester United at the start of March, but after a slow start they ruthlessly dismantled Javi Gracia’s hapless side.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold used an arm to control the ball, but neither the referee or the VAR felt it worthy of penalising, before he drove forward to exchange passes with Salah and set up Cody Gakpo for the opener.\n\nThe Egypt forward doubled his side’s lead soon after, firing a sweet shot in after being set up by Jota to put the visitors in control.\n\nLeeds were given hope after the break when Luis Sinisterra dispossessed the ponderous Ibrahima Konate and cleverly chipped the ball beyond Alisson.\n\nHowever, Liverpool quickly responded through Jota’s neat finish as the Portugal forward notched his first goal since April 2022.'

        description: 'Tensions between Israel and the Palestinians are on the rise once more, with hopes of peace and a two-state solution as far away as ever.',
        text: 'Jerusalem is a holy city of true believers. The atmosphere here crackles loudest when the faithful celebrate their religious holidays, especially in the walled Old City where the Christian, Jewish and Islamic holy sites are minutes away from each other.\n\nReligion has a significance and power here that is hard to exaggerate. That is because it is about more than just faith. In Jerusalem it is linked inextricably with Palestinian and Israeli nationalism. Religion, politics and identity feed off each other. The rivals venerate the sanctity of Jerusalem and claim it as their capital.\n\nThis month Ramadan, Passover and Easter have fallen at the same time. They have also coincided with accelerating danger and despair.\n\nTwo years ago, heavy-handed policing by Israel of Palestinians during Ramadan was one of the sparks for a short and deadly war in and around Gaza between the Israelis and Hamas, the Palestinian group whose name is an acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement.'

        text: 'Tehran has played down the impact of Israeli airstrikes carried out against Iran, raising hopes that a cycle of escalatory state-on-state attacks can be averted – and that previous Iranian threats to retaliate harshly will be shelved.\n\nBut Iran remains on alert in case the attacks, during which explosions were reported in the sky over the cities of Isfahan and Tabriz, do not mark the end Israel’s response to the massive missile and drone attack launched by Tehran last Saturday night.\n\nSpeaking in New York, the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said the drones caused no damage or casualties. “The Zionist regime’s media supporters, in a desperate effort, tried to make victory out of their defeat, while the downed mini-drones have not caused any damage or casualties,” he said.\n\nThe military commander of Isfahan province in central Iran said the explosion heard early on Friday morning was due to air defence firing at suspicious objects and that the action did not lead to any accident or damage on the ground. Other reports suggested that the windows in several office buildings were broken.'

        description: 'In Maya temple-pyramid, archaeologists recently discovered the scorched bones of at least four adults.',
        text: 'The bones offer a rare glimpse of intentional corpse destruction in Maya culture to commemorate dramatic political change.\n\nAll of the remains belonged to adults, and scientists identified three of the individuals as male. Two were between 21 and 35 years old, and one was between 40 and 60 years old, researchers reported Thursday in the journal Antiquity. Among the bones were thousands of burned objects — whole and in pieces — including body adornments made of greenstone (green minerals, including jade), pendants made from mammal teeth, shell beads, mosaics and weapons. Their richness and abundance hinted at the royal status of the people in the tomb.\n\nBut the burning of artifacts and remains was unusual for royalty, as was their placement in this pyramid chamber. The revelation shed light on the rise of a new type of leader who likely redefined power during a time of societal transformation, the study authors said.'

And the company has created more than 200,000 jobs in Vietnam, it added.\n\nAccording to the statement, Cook said Apple “stands ready … to enhance cooperation and investment activities” in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nHis visit highlights Vietnam’s growing importance to global companies looking for alternatives to China as trade tensions between Beijing and the West have escalated in recent years.\n\nVietnam has been a “major beneficiary” of moves by multinational companies to diversify their manufacturing hubs — a strategy known as “China plus one” — says Thuy Anh Nguyen, a strategist at Dragon Capital, a local fund management firm that invests solely in Vietnamese companies.'

        text: 'Set to become the world’s second-tallest clock tower (after the Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia), Aeternitas Tower is the result of a partnership between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller.\n\nLondon Gate purchased the plot of land in Dubai Marina, which already had the beginnings of an unfinished 106-story structure — and knew that the tower’s monumental size needed a striking facade, said Tom Hill, media relations coordinator for the developer.\n\n“We believe the clock will be seen from six kilometers away because of the sheer height of the building,” said Hill, adding that the clock face will be an enormous 40 meters (131 feet) tall and 30 meters (98 feet) wide.\n\n“We wanted to do something different that hasn’t been done before in Dubai,” said Hill.'
